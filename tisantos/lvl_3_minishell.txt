Lifetime of a Shell:

A shell does three main things in its lifetime:

	Initialize:
	In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its configuration files.
	These change aspects of the shellâ€™s behavior.

	Interpret:
	Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be interactive, or a file)
	and executes them.

	Terminate: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any shutdown
	commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.


The program needs to loop in order to work. And in the most basic form, the loop
will do 3 things:

	Read:
	Read the command from standard input.

	Parse:
	Separate the command string into a program and arguments.

	Execute:
	Run the parsed command.

get_next_line (fd, buffer(**line)).
									Inside of gnl you have a buffer_size.
									You can change it on get_next_line.h

stdin:  Same as fd = 0.		<--- This is what the keyboard writes.
stdout: Same as fd = 1. 	<--- This is what the shell terminal shows.
stderr: Same as fd = 2. 	<--- This is what the shell terminal shows.
